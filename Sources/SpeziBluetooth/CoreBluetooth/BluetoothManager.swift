/// Connect and communicate with Bluetooth devices.
///
/// This module allows to connect and communicate with Bluetooth devices using modern programming paradigms.
/// Under the hood this module uses Apple's [CoreBluetooth](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corebluetooth).
///
/// ### Configure the Bluetooth Manager
///
/// To configure the Bluetooth Manager, you need to specify what devices you want to discover and what services and
/// characteristics you are interested in.
/// To do so, provide a set of ``DiscoveryDescription``s upon initialization of the `BluetoothManager`.
///
/// Below is a short code example to discover devices with a Heart Rate service.
///
/// ```swift
/// let manager = BluetoothManager()
///
/// manager.scanNearbyDevices(discovery: devices [
///     DeviceDescription(discoverBy: .advertisedService("180D"), services: [
///         ServiceDescription(serviceId: "180D", characteristics: [
///             "2A37", // heart rate measurement
///             "2A38", // body sensor location
///             "2A39" // heart rate control point
///         ])
///     ])
/// ])
/// // ...
/// manager.stopScanning()
/// ```
///
/// ### Searching for nearby devices
///
/// You can scan for nearby devices using the ``scanNearbyDevices(discovery:minimumRSSI:advertisementStaleInterval:autoConnect:)`` and stop scanning with ``stopScanning()``.
/// All discovered peripherals will be populated through the ``nearbyPeripherals`` properties.
///
/// Refer to the documentation of ``BluetoothPeripheral`` on how to interact with a Bluetooth peripheral.
///
/// - Tip: You can also use the ``SwiftUI/View/scanNearbyDevices(enabled:with:discovery:minimumRSSI:advertisementStaleInterval:autoConnect:)``
///     and ``SwiftUI/View/autoConnect(enabled:with:discovery:minimumRSSI:advertisementStaleInterval:)``
///     modifiers within your SwiftUI view to automatically manage device scanning and/or auto connect to the
///     first available device.
///
/// ## Topics
///
/// ### Create a Bluetooth Manager
///
/// - ``init()``
///
/// ### Bluetooth State
///
/// - ``state``
/// - ``isScanning``
/// - ``stateSubscription``
///
/// ### Discovering nearby Peripherals
/// - ``nearbyPeripherals``
/// - ``scanNearbyDevices(discovery:minimumRSSI:advertisementStaleInterval:autoConnect:)``
/// - ``stopScanning()``
/// - ``SwiftUI/View/scanNearbyDevices(enabled:with:discovery:minimumRSSI:advertisementStaleInterval:autoConnect:)``
/// - ``SwiftUI/View/autoConnect(enabled:with:discovery:minimumRSSI:advertisementStaleInterval:)``
///
/// ### Retrieving known Peripherals
/// - ``retrievePeripheral(for:with:)``
///
/// ### Manually Manage Powered State
/// - ``powerOn()``
/// - ``powerOff()``

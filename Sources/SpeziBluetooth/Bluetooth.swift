/// Connect and communicate with Bluetooth devices using modern programming paradigms.
///
/// This module allows to connect and communicate with Bluetooth devices using modern programming paradigms.
/// Under the hood this module uses Apple's [CoreBluetooth](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corebluetooth)
/// through the ``BluetoothManager``.
///
/// ### Create your Bluetooth device
///
/// The Bluetooth module allows to declarative define your Bluetooth device using a ``BluetoothDevice`` implementation and property wrappers
/// like ``Service`` and ``Characteristic``.
///
/// The below code examples demonstrate how you can implement your own Bluetooth device.
///
/// First of all we define our Bluetooth service by implementing a ``BluetoothService``.
/// We use the ``Characteristic`` property wrapper to declare its characteristics.
/// [`ByteEncodable`](https://swiftpackageindex.com/stanfordspezi/spezifileformats/documentation/bytecoding/byteencodable),
/// [`ByteDecodable`](https://swiftpackageindex.com/stanfordspezi/spezifileformats/1.0.0/documentation/bytecoding/bytedecodable) or
/// [`ByteCodable`](https://swiftpackageindex.com/stanfordspezi/spezifileformats/documentation/bytecoding/bytecodable) respectively.
///
/// ```swift
/// struct DeviceInformationService: BluetoothService {
///    static let id: BTUUID = "180A"
///
///     @Characteristic(id: "2A29")
///     var manufacturer: String?
///     @Characteristic(id: "2A26")
///     var firmwareRevision: String?
/// }
/// ```
///
/// We can use this Bluetooth service now in the `MyDevice` implementation as follows.
///
/// - Tip: We use the ``DeviceState`` and ``DeviceAction`` property wrappers to get access to the device state and its actions. Those two
///     property wrappers can also be used within a ``BluetoothService`` type.
///
/// ```swift
/// class MyDevice: BluetoothDevice {
///     @DeviceState(\.id)
///     var id: UUID
///     @DeviceState(\.name)
///     var name: String?
///     @DeviceState(\.state)
///     var state: PeripheralState
///
///     @Service var deviceInformation = DeviceInformationService()
///
///     @DeviceAction(\.connect)
///     var connect
///     @DeviceAction(\.disconnect)
///     var disconnect
///
///     required init() {}
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Configure the Bluetooth Module
///
/// We use the above `BluetoothDevice` implementation to configure the `Bluetooth` module within the
/// [SpeziAppDelegate](https://swiftpackageindex.com/stanfordspezi/spezi/documentation/spezi/speziappdelegate).
///
/// ```swift
/// import Spezi
///
/// class ExampleDelegate: SpeziAppDelegate {
///     override var configuration: Configuration {
///         Configuration {
///             Bluetooth {
///                 // Define which devices type to discover by what criteria .
///                 // In this case we search for some custom FFF0 service that is advertised.
///                 Discover(MyDevice.self, by: .advertisedService("FFF0"))
///             }
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Using the Bluetooth Module
///
/// Once you have the `Bluetooth` module configured within your Spezi app, you can access the module within your
/// [`Environment`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/environment).
///
/// You can use the ``SwiftUI/View/scanNearbyDevices(enabled:with:minimumRSSI:advertisementStaleInterval:autoConnect:)``
///  and ``SwiftUI/View/autoConnect(enabled:with:minimumRSSI:advertisementStaleInterval:)``
/// modifiers to scan for nearby devices and/or auto connect to the first available device. Otherwise, you can also manually start and stop scanning for nearby devices
/// using ``scanNearbyDevices(minimumRSSI:advertisementStaleInterval:autoConnect:)`` and ``stopScanning()``.
///
/// To retrieve the list of nearby devices you may use ``nearbyDevices(for:)``.
///
/// > Tip: To easily access the first connected device, you can just query the SwiftUI Environment for your `BluetoothDevice` type.
///     Make sure to declare the property as optional using the respective [`Environment(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/environment/init(_:)-8slkf)
///     initializer.
///
/// The below code example demonstrates all these steps of retrieving the `Bluetooth` module from the environment, listing all nearby devices,
/// auto connecting to the first one and displaying some basic information of the currently connected device.
///
/// ```swift
/// import SpeziBluetooth
/// import SwiftUI
///
/// struct MyView: View {
///     @Environment(Bluetooth.self)
///     var bluetooth
///     @Environment(MyDevice.self)
///     var myDevice: MyDevice?
///
///     var body: some View {
///         List {
///             if let myDevice {
///                 Section {
///                     Text("Device")
///                     Spacer()
///                     Text("\(myDevice.state.description)")
///                 }
///             }
///
///             Section {
///                 ForEach(bluetooth.nearbyDevices(for: MyDevice.self), id: \.id) { device in
///                     Text("\(device.name ?? "unknown")")
///                 }
///             } header: {
///                 HStack {
///                     Text("Devices")
///                         .padding(.trailing, 10)
///                     if bluetooth.isScanning {
///                         ProgressView()
///                     }
///                 }
///             }
///         }
///             .scanNearbyDevices(with: bluetooth, autoConnect: true)
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// - Tip: Use ``ConnectedDevices`` to retrieve the full list of connected devices from the SwiftUI environment.
///
/// #### Retrieving Devices
///
/// The previous section explained how to discover nearby devices and retrieve the currently connected one from the environment.
/// This is great ad-hoc connection establishment with devices currently nearby.
/// However, this might not be the most efficient approach, if you want to connect to a specific, previously paired device.
/// In these situations you can use the ``retrieveDevice(for:as:)`` method to retrieve a known device.
///
/// Below is a short code example illustrating this method.
///
/// ```swift
/// let id: UUID = ... // a Bluetooth peripheral identifier (e.g., previously retrieved when pairing the device)
///
/// let device = bluetooth.retrieveDevice(for: id, as: MyDevice.self)
///
/// await device.connect() // assume declaration of @DeviceAction(\.connect)
///
/// // Connect doesn't time out. Connection with the device will be established as soon as the device is in reach.
/// ```
///
/// ### Integration with Spezi Modules
///
/// A Spezi [`Module`](https://swiftpackageindex.com/stanfordspezi/spezi/documentation/spezi/module) is a great way of structuring your application into
/// different subsystems and provides extensive capabilities to model relationship and dependence between modules.
/// Every ``BluetoothDevice`` is a `Module`.
/// Therefore, you can easily access your SpeziBluetooth device from within any Spezi `Module` using the standard
/// [Module Dependency](https://swiftpackageindex.com/stanfordspezi/spezi/documentation/spezi/module-dependency) infrastructure. At the same time,
/// every `BluetoothDevice` can benefit from the same capabilities as every other Spezi `Module`.
///
/// Below is a short code example demonstrating how a `BluetoothDevice` uses the `@Dependency` property to interact with a Spezi Module that is
/// configured within the Spezi application.
///
/// ```swift
/// class Measurements: Module, EnvironmentAccessible, DefaultInitializable {
///     required init() {}
///
///     func recordNewMeasurement(_ measurement: WeightMeasurement) {
///         // ... process measurement
///     }
/// }
///
/// class MyDevice: BluetoothDevice {
///     @Service var weightScale = WeightScaleService()
///
///     // declare dependency to a configured Spezi Module
///     @Dependency var measurements: Measurements
///
///     required init() {}
///
///     func configure() {
///         weightScale.$weightMeasurement.onChange { [weak self] value in
///             self?.handleNewMeasurement(value)
///         }
///     }
///
///     private func handleNewMeasurement(_ measurement: WeightMeasurement) {
///         measurements.recordNewMeasurement(measurement)
///     }
/// }
/// ```
